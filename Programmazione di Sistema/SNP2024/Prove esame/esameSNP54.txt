Please create  a directory named youraccount.esameSNP54 in your home on
hplinux3.unisalento.it (e.g. franco.esameSNP54) and solve the exercise in that
directory or, alternatively, create a directory with the same name in your
macOS home, and solve the exercise in that directory. Eventually, transfer it
to your home on hplinux3.unisalento.it.

The created programs must be SUSv3 compliant and a makefile must be provided.
If the solution and the compliance are not possible together, the solution
must anyway be working both on Linux and macOS. In the same directory, a file
named README.txt containing a description of the solution and, possibly,
comments/observations on the choices made to solve the problem, MUST be
placed. Keep in mind that the file may help the reader to understand the logic
you adopted and to better appreciate your work.

When finished, execute in your own Linux account the following command line:

cd; tar cvfz $USER.esameSNP54.tgz $USER.esameSNP54

[BEWARE: the command above shown must be issued in the shell running in the
Linux machine, AFTER the folder youraccount.esameSNP54 has been transferred to
your home on hplinux3.unisalento.it and NOT when it's still in your home on
macOS (if you wrote the program there). ]

Exercise

A process P1 acts as a UDP server. When it receives a text message from
any client it writes the IP address of the client and the received text
message in two lines of a POSIX shared memory. Another process P2 must read
each of the two lines from the shared memory and append them to a file. 
P1 and P2 must manage concurrency through a record locking mechanism.
