Please create  a directory named youraccount.esameSNP55 in your home on
hplinux3.unisalento.it (e.g. franco.esameSNP55) and solve the exercise
in that directory or, alternatively, create a directory with the same
name in your macOS home, and solve the exercise in that directory.
Eventually, transfer it to your home on hplinux3.unisalento.it.

The created programs must be SUSv3 compliant and a makefile must be
provided. If the solution and the compliance are not possible together,
the solution must anyway be working both on Linux and macOS. In the same
directory, a file named README.txt containing a description of the
solution and, possibly, comments/observations on the choices made to
solve the problem, MUST be placed. Keep in mind that the file may help
the reader to understand the logic you adopted and to better appreciate
your work.

When finished, execute in your own Linux account the following command
line:

cd; tar cvfz $USER.esameSNP55.tgz $USER.esameSNP55

[BEWARE: the command above shown must be issued in the shell running in
the Linux machine, AFTER the folder youraccount.esameSNP55 has been
transferred to your home on hplinux3.unisalento.it and NOT when it's
still in your home on macOS (if you wrote the program there). ]

Exercise

Build a C program that takes a directory path as an argument and has two
threads:
1) thread1 takes the argument and find all the regular files whose path 
is rooted in the argument and have a link count greater than 1.
2) thread2 takes each found file and looks for files with the same inode 
of the found file in the same hierarchy where the search was conducted.

Have the two threads properly synchronized.
