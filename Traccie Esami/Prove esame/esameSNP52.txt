Please create  a directory named youraccount.esameSNP52 in your home on
hplinux2.unisalento.it (e.g. franco.esameSNP52) and solve the exercise in that
directory or, alternatively, create a directory with the same name in your
macOS home, and solve the exercise in that directory. Eventually, transfer it
to your home on hplinux2.unisalento.it.

The created programs must be SUSv3 compliant and a makefile must be provided.
If the solution and the compliance are not possible together, the solution
must anyway be working both on Linux and macOS. In the same directory, a file
named README.txt containing a description of the solution and, possibly,
comments/observations on the choices made to solve the problem, MUST be
placed. Keep in mind that the file may help the reader to understand the logic
you adopted and to better appreciate your work.

When finished, execute in your own Linux account the following command line:

cd; tar cvfz $USER.esameSNP52.tgz $USER.esameSNP52

[BEWARE: the command above shown must be issued in the shell running in the
Linux machine, AFTER the folder youraccount.esameSNP52 has been transferred to
your home on hplinux2.unisalento.it and NOT when it's still in your home on
macOS (if you wrote the program there). ]

Exercise

A 4-way crossroads must be simulated by C programs as follows:

1) 4 processes simulate the 4 roads by generating a random arrival of
vehicles and a fifth process is in charge of the control of the
crossroadss;

2) Once one of the four ways lets the first vehicle in its queue move
through the crossroads, the other three roads will keep their vehicles
from crossing it.

3) Crossing the crossroads takes 3 seconds and, after that, the moving
vehicle is removed from the queue.

4) When the vehicle has crossed the crossroads, any of the first
vehicles in the queues of each of the four roads is allowed to move.
